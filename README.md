# Dwains Lovelace Dashboard Community Addons

Welcome to the community addons repository. In this repository you'll find many addons to use inside Dwains Dashboard v2.0 (Note the addons do not work in v3.0!)

With Dwains Dashboard Addons you can extend the theme functionality with addons without changing any of the themes cores code. This way you can always update to the latest version without problems but still add your own views/cards.

There are a few types off addons currently available:

### Rooms Addon
With the **Rooms addon** you can add your own functionality to rooms. You can add a button on a room page which links to a custom page. It's also possible to parse some data in that view. 

### More page addon
With **More page addon** you can still add own pages to Dwains Dashboard, you even can put them in the main navbar! Letâ€™s say you want a page with some statistics or just an extra page with some cards. Then more page addons is the way to go.

### Persons addon
With the **Persons addon** you can add your own cards to a person page. Like for example a map, traveling time to work or home. It's also possible to parse some data in that view. 

### House information addon
With **House information addon** you can add own cards to the global house information page. Like for example an calendar, traveling time to work or home. It's also possible to parse some data in that view.  

### Popup addons
With popup addons you can add own card(s) to a popup of an entity. So for example if you click on switch.diswasher you also see the power usage of the diswasher.
